      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-内存流&#34;&gt;1, 内存流&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, the standard I/O library buffers data in memory, so operations such as character-at-a-time I/O and line-at-a-time I/O are more efficient. We’ve also seen that we can provide our own buffer for the library to use by calling setbuf or setvbuf. In Version 4, the Single UNIX Specification added support for memory streams. These are standard I/O streams for which there are no underlying files, although they are still accessed with FILE pointers. All I/O is done by transferring bytes to and from buffers in main memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
